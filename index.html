        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>
            Youth for Environment And Social Transformation (YEAST), a typical stage for every one of the imaginative personalities, was established as a non-profit, non-governmental organization. The organization was established on 17th April 2022 by the inception of dynamic understudies of different establishments connected with applied sciences alongside the guidance of senior educators as consultants. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Essentially, the organization aims to enhance the development of character and leadership abilities in students by conducting various training, discussions, debate sessions, courses, and meetings. It also works to spread the knowledge and skills learned to local farmers. YEAST aims to bridge the gap between rural, environmental, and social education and local communities, helping them understand things more appropriately and practically at the ground level.
        </p>
        <p>
            YEAST has been working in various fields, including the environment, social issues, education, veterinary, and agricultural sectors, since its foundation.
