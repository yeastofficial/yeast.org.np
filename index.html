                <p className="text-sm">
                  YEAST (Youth for Environment And Social Transformation) has been actively implementing Animal Birth Control (ABC) initiatives to promote animal welfare, curb the stray dog population, and prevent zoonotic diseases such as rabies. The ABC program involves the humane sterilization of stray dogs, followed by vaccination and release back to their original habitats. This scientifically proven method reduces overpopulation, minimizes human-animal conflicts, and enhances public health. YEAST collaborates with local municipalities, farmers, and volunteers to identify stray dog populations, organize ABC camps, and raise awareness about responsible pet ownership. Over the past years, YEAST has successfully sterilized and vaccinated over 1,800 dogs across various districts, including Arghakhanchi, Butwal, Palpa, Nawalpur, and Rupandehi.

The program operates in seasonal phases, such as the Animal Birth Control & Anti-Rabies Vaccination Program in Butwal, where 186 dogs were sterilized in just three days. Despite challenges like logistical issues in rural areas and community misconceptions about sterilization, YEAST has worked with local governments to overcome these obstacles. The impact of the program includes reduced stray dog populations, lower rabies risks, and improved human-animal coexistence. YEASTâ€™s ABC initiative reflects its commitment to the One Health approach, integrating animal welfare, public health, and environmental sustainability, with plans for expanding the program and incorporating technology for monitoring sterilized animals.
